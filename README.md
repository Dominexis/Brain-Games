# Brain-Games
Brain Games will be a group project much like Project Run where a bunch of mapmakers come together to make one grand experience. The map this time will be specifically about puzzles and problem-solving. The contributors will have full access to data packs and resource packs through Git, and can design their own mechanics and puzzles around those mechanics.

Because the map will be about puzzles, there will be certain requirements to ensure that the puzzles are coherent and well-designed:

- Puzzles should be mechanics-based where you learn how to use the mechanics given to you to solve the puzzle. This means that your section can't just be parkour, a maze, find the button, trivia, etc.
- Your section should be divided up into levels of gradually increasing difficulty so that the players have time to learn the mechanics.
- The objective in an area (which will usually be reaching a certain location, whether that is opening a door or something else) must be immediately visible and obvious. The puzzle is not about guessing what you're supposed to do, but about figuring out what to do to actually achieve it.
- The first and final areas of your section will be united with neighboring sections with generic vault doors which will be provided to you.
- Be mindful of how many players your puzzles require. If the location/state of the player is integral to solving the puzzle, then the number of players must be a specific amount. But if the location/state of the player is irrelevant, then it can handle any number of players.
- Because you will be working alongside others, don't modify vanilla assets in either the data pack or the resource pack without asking about it first.
- Your section must thoroughly reset when there is no one inside and must not cause lag when it is not running. 
- If you want to edit vanilla assets, ask about it first.
